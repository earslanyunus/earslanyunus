# Hi I'm Yunus Emre Arslan

## Who Am I
* 💻I'm trying to become a Front-End developer.
* 👨‍🎓I'm a student of Visual Communication Design

I want to specialize in Front-End developing  while combining it with my UI/UX design skills. I believe that in the future, user experience will be even more important, so my knowledge of UX and UI will help me to develop software. That's why I am studying visual communication design.
* 🎨 I am interested in 3d visualization in my free time. You can see my work from the Behance link below
