# Hi I'm Yunus Emre Arslan

## Who Am I
* 💻I'm trying to be a front-end developer
* 👨‍🎓I'm studens at Visual Communication Design

I want to specialize in UI/UX design and combine that with front-end skills. We are going to a future where user experience matters so I think my UX and UI knowledge will help me in developing software. That's why I'm studying visual communication design.
* 🎨 I am interested in 3d visualization in my free time. You can see my work from the Behance link below
